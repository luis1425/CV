                    <p><em>Cover Letter & Resume</em></p>
                    <p>As a political science major, I always had the interest in working in politics or in the nonprofit industry and making a difference in communities. 
                     Over the past year I worked at Comite Civico del Valle, a non-profit organization located in Imperial County. 
                     Imperial County is the poorest County in the State of California and has the second highest unemployment rate in the United States so 
                     I have a lot of experience working with underserved and disadvantaged communities. I attended and planned many events during the past year. 
                     I performed outreach to the hard to reach communities to listen to their needs and attended meetings with government officials to update them on our needs, the most notable government official being the Secretary of the Department of Energy of the United States. 
                     In the picture, you can see me (on the right) talking to the Secretary of the CNRA, Wade Crowfoot, about our environmental concerns that we endure in Imperial County. I acquired great experience and skills over the past year and I am ready to expand my knowledge and skills and help out in any way that I can. 
                     Thank you for taking the time to read my brief cover letter and I hope I can expand more on my skills and experience.
